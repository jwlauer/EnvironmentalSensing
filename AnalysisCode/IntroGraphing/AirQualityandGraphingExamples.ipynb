Then click the csv button in the lower right to download the file.  Open the file in Excel and note that the data appear to start on line 10 of the file. This should be the same format as the data used in the above examples. The first column is date/time, and the second is the PM2.5 measurement. \n",

If you can find one with more than one PM2.5 measurement method, include the measurements from both methods on that figure. Turn in the graph, along with a descriptive caption, as part of your assignment on Thursday. "
