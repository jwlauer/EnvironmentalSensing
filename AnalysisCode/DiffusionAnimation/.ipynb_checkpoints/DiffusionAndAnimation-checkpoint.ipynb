We then set several parameters needed by the animation function. Here, we pass the time interval between frames (milliseconds), a flag specifying whether the animation repeats when done, the total number of steps to include in the animation, the delay (milliseconds) after an animation is done before repeating, and a flag (blit) to tell the system not to re-write parts of the figure that are not changing.\n",
